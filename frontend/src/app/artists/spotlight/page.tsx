      name: "Bruce Melody",
      genre: "Afrobeats, Hip-Hop",
      bio: "Bruce Melody is one of Rwanda's most influential contemporary artists, known for his unique blend of traditional Rwandan sounds with modern Afrobeats and hip-hop. His music addresses social issues while celebrating Rwandan culture, making him a voice for his generation.",
      achievements: [
        "Multiple award-winning artist in East Africa",
        "Over 50 million streams across platforms",
        "Featured in international music festivals",
        "Collaborated with artists across Africa and Europe",
        "Advocate for youth empowerment through music"
      ],
      interview: [
        {
          question: "What inspired you to pursue music as a career?",
          answer: "Growing up in Rwanda, I was surrounded by incredible traditional music, but I always felt drawn to tell contemporary stories. Music became my way of expressing the experiences of young Rwandans navigating modern life while honoring our heritage. I realized that through music, I could bridge generations and cultures."
        },
        {
          question: "How do you balance traditional Rwandan elements with modern sounds?",
          answer: "It's about respect and intention. I don't just sample traditional instruments for aesthetic purposes—I study their cultural significance and history. When I incorporate Ingoma drums or Intore dancing rhythms, it's because they carry meaning that enhances the story I'm telling. The traditional elements ground the music in our identity while modern production makes it accessible to global audiences."
        },
        {
          question: "What challenges have you faced as a Rwandan artist?",
          answer: "Early on, there was skepticism about whether Rwandan music could compete internationally. Infrastructure was limited—recording studios were expensive, distribution networks were weak, and there wasn't much industry support. But these challenges forced us to be innovative. We learned to produce high-quality music with limited resources and found creative ways to reach audiences directly through social media."
        },
        {
          question: "What advice would you give to emerging artists?",
          answer: "Focus on authenticity over trends. Your unique perspective is your greatest asset. Invest in developing your craft consistently rather than chasing viral moments. Build genuine relationships with your audience—they're your foundation for sustainable success. And never stop learning, both about music and the business side of the industry."

      ],
      interview: [
        {
          question: "How did you develop your distinctive vocal style?",
          answer: "My voice naturally gravitated toward melodic styles, but I spent years studying different genres to find my sweet spot. I drew inspiration from classic soul singers, contemporary Afrobeats artists, and even Rwandan traditional vocalists. The key was finding the intersection where my natural tone meets the emotional delivery that connects with listeners."
        },
        {
          question: "What role does storytelling play in your music?",
          answer: "Every song is a story I want people to feel. Whether it's about love, ambition, or overcoming challenges, I try to paint vivid pictures with my lyrics. My goal is for listeners to see themselves in my songs—to feel understood and less alone in their experiences. The melodies carry the emotion, but the stories create lasting connections."
        },
        {
          question: "How has your success impacted the Rwandan music scene?",
          answer: "I hope my success shows young Rwandan artists that our music belongs on the world stage. When I started, there were doubts about whether Rwandan artists could achieve international recognition. Now, labels and investors are paying attention to our market. More importantly, young artists see that success is possible while staying true to our cultural identity."
        },
        {
          question: "What's next for your career?",
          answer: "I'm working on expanding beyond just music—fashion collaborations, acting opportunities, and eventually launching my own record label to support emerging talent. But the music always comes first. I'm currently in the studio working on my most personal project yet, exploring themes of growth, legacy, and what it means to represent Rwanda on the global stage."

      ],
      interview: [
        {
          question: "What motivated you to enter the music industry?",
          answer: "I saw a gap that needed filling. When I looked at Rwanda's music scene, I noticed women were often relegated to background vocals or traditional roles. I wanted to show that female artists could be front and center—powerful, successful, and in control of their narrative. Music gave me the platform to challenge stereotypes and inspire other women to pursue their dreams boldly."
        },
        {
          question: "How do you navigate being a woman in the music industry?",
          answer: "It requires extra resilience and strategic thinking. I've learned to be assertive about my worth while maintaining professionalism. Having a strong team that respects my vision is crucial. I also make it a point to support other female artists—when we lift each other up, we all rise. The industry is slowly changing, and I'm proud to be part of that evolution."
        },
        {
          question: "Your style is quite distinctive. How does fashion relate to your music?",
          answer: "Style and sound are inseparable for me. My fashion choices reflect the confidence and attitude in my music. When I'm on stage, every element—from my outfit to my choreography to my vocal delivery—should communicate the same message of strength and authenticity. Fashion becomes another instrument in my artistic expression."
        },
        {
          question: "What legacy do you hope to leave?",
          answer: "I want to be remembered as someone who opened doors for the next generation of female artists. Beyond the music, I hope my journey shows young Rwandan women that they can be bold, ambitious, and successful while staying true to themselves. Success isn't about fitting into predefined boxes—it's about creating your own path and inspiring others to do the same."
